Sometimes when you are out and about, far from the kitchen, you need takeaways. 

And what is more delicious than Pizza?

So listed below are some things I have learnt while working out what pizza I can eat in Wellington. All prices given are in New Zealand dollars. Prices may have changed since this post was written (July 2014). 

#### Sauce options are limited but pizza can still be tasty without it.
While tomatoes and cranberries in their fruit form are considered suitable low FODMAP food, the quantities of FODMAPs in concentrated forms are often too high for some people with IBS. The quantity of tomato paste or cranberry sauce that can be consumed without ill effects will vary from person to person and also between different pizza brands. 

I am not brave enough to try pizza with tomato paste, however I have eaten half a large pizza with cranberry sauce on it and had minimal side effects. If you think you can handle it, cranberry sauce is a good option. Otherwise a pizza without sauce can still be very delicious.

#### Go to Hell! (or Heaven)

Both Heaven Woodfire Pizza & Hell Pizza make delicious takeaway pizza that can work for a low Fodmap diet. They are not the cheapest of options in the world of pizza but definitely worth it if you have the dollars. 

[Heaven](http://heavenspizza.co.nz/) is a Wellington woodfire pizza place that have nice gluten free bases. Last time I looked, suitable small pizzas retail from $11 NZD but expect to spend about $25 NZD/pizza as you will be tempted by their delicious toppings and a larger size (for tasty left-overs).  
Heaven is only one of a few woodfire pizza places in Wellington that have gluten free bases. Others include; [mediterranean food warehouse](http://www.medifoods.co.nz/pizzeria/), [One Red Dog](http://onereddog.co.nz/menus/menu.pdf) and [Pizza Pomodoro](http://www.pizzapomodoro.co.nz/#!lunchdinner/clbz).

[Hell](http://hellpizza.com/nz/) is a New Zealand wide pizza place. Suitable snack size pizzas retail from $10 NZD. You might find yourself paying up to $21.50 NZD for a double gourmet. If you want an easy low FODMAP decision, the Pandemonium is very tasty, although take care with the quantity of cranberry sauce you consume. 

#### On a budget? Try [Domino’s pizza](http://www.dominospizza.co.nz/menu/pizzas).
Dominio’s pizza is only cheap if you stick to the basic toppings. If you are spending $20+ on a pizza at Domonio’s you should be going somewhere else (cough-Hells-cough). Pizzas retail from $8 NZD.

You could try a Hawaiian pizza with a gluten free base and no tomato paste. 

Make sure you end up with mozzarella cheese and not the liquid cheese. The liquid cheese is likely to be low FODMAP but the [food additives list](http://www.dominospizza.co.nz/media/347490/nz0811-allergen-brochure-june-2014.pdf) is scary.
 
#### Want cheese on your pizza? - no problem

Mozzarella, parmesan, feta and brie are okay. Pretty much no lactose is in the harder cheeses and the softer ones listed have an amount not worth worrying about (for most people). 

#### Pizza toppings

Most places in Wellington seem to have most of the following toppings:  
mozzarella, camembert, feta, cranberry sauce, chicken, bacon, ham, tomatoes, cherry tomatoes, olives, capsicum, spinach, pineapple. 

Classic topping combinations to try:

* mozzarella, bacon, ham, pineapple
* camembert, cranberry sauce, chicken
* feta, bacon, cherry tomatoes, olives, spinach, capsicum

#### Home-made Pizza
I am sure there are heaps of recipes floating around the internet for pizza bases, like this [one](http://www.mydarlinglemonthyme.com/2011/03/gluten-free-pizza-recipe.html). I haven't tried any yet as I have been lazy and just bought bases from the supermarket. None of them have been that great, so I won't mention any of them.
