Does asking for a curry without onion and garlic feel like asking for the impossible? 

Well, fear not. Such a thing exists….

 and it can taste good!

I don’t know how much luck you will have with restaurants but below are some ideas for whipping up a delicious, hot curry at home. All prices given in New Zealand dollars at the time of posting. 

#### Let’s start with the easy packet option
When I first started on the low FODMAP diet I asked a couple of friends for some tips. One of my favourite tips was that the Asian Home Gourmet range have a Rogan Josh curry paste free of onion, garlic and wheat!  
 So for a quick, easy curry buy some Rogan Josh paste ($2.55 NZD at Countdown), add some coconut milk, some meat (lamb or goat is traditional but beef is fine), some low FODMAP vegetables and some rice to put it on. 

#### Low FODMAP butter chicken
I have cooked [this recipe](http://www.fodmapfun.com/butter-chicken-curry-low-fodmap-recipe/) multiple times and I love it. I don’t miss the flavour of garlic and onion in it at all. This curry also makes a good vegetarian curry with potatoes and whatever other vegetables you have in the fridge. I think it could also be nice with fish or prawns but I haven’t tried that yet. 

#### Thai red curry
Before going on the low FODMAP diet, one of my favourite quick and easy currys was thai red curry paste (from the supermarket) + pumpkin soup + prawns + green beans.  
One time my brother made it  so spicy that tears poured out of my eyes the whole time I was eating it. My Aunty, who dislikes milk, ended up with a hokey pokey icecream in one hand, her fork in the other and would alternate between eating the spicy curry and the icecream to cool her mouth down.  
To make a low FODMAP version of this you will need to make your own thai red curry paste, see [this recipe](http://www.lowfodmaprecipes.co.uk/low-fodmap-thai-red-curry-paste/).  
I am not sure what canned pumpkin soups are free of onion and garlic but I like making large batches of pumpkin soup when pumpkins are cheap and freezing it for lunches, quick dinners and, of course, this recipe. 

#### Two nice vegetarian curries (I think)
[This recipe for a spinach and potato curry](http://www.steamingpot.com/spinach-potato-curry/) looks nice.
[This recipe for a curry called Lauki Aloo](http://www.steamingpot.com/bottlegourd-potato-stew/) looks nice as well. I haven’t tried yet but they are on my to-do list so thought I may as well mention them.

#### And finally, Thanks Jamie!
From the same friend who suggested the Rogan Josh packet was the recommendation to check out [Jamie’s spice pastes.](http://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/recipe/easy-homemade-curry-pastes)

To make these recipes low FODMAP:
 
* swap out garlic for garlic oil
* take care with quantity of tomato paste
* take care of quantity of ground almond or replace with another sort of ground nut
