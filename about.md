This is a space for me to share my FODMAP frustrations, fixes & fun! I hope that you will share with me your tips & tricks as well. This way we can increase our collective knowledge and show our fussy stomachs WHO'S THE BOSS!

I'm a Kiwi, working in the windy capital. In 2011 I discovered that cutting wheat out of my diet reduced the discomfort in my stomach that had been plaguing me for awhile. I was very happy with the improvements. 

In 2014, my stomach was still better than it was in my wheat-eating days but oh boy was there room for improvement. There were just too many nights of broken sleep or times where I would lose focus at work because of a sore stomach. So I went to a dietician, got some solid advice and started on a low FODMAP diet. 

So far the low FODMAP diet has worked well for me. I feel more in control of my stomach. However knowing what to eat, sorting out dinners & lunches, eating out with friends, all of this has been hard. There have been many frustrating moments. Like most things, it is getting easier with experience and in this blog I would like to share some things I have found. I also welcome you to share your experiences back.
