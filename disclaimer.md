I have no food/medicine related degrees hanging on my wall. These are my own personal experiences. People’s sensitivities to the different FODMAP groups vary. Some things will work for me that won’t work for you. If you are having issues with your stomach, don’t replace professional help with Dr. Google, go see a dietician or a doctor.

Research is still being undertaken for the quantity and type of FODMAPs present in different food. Sometimes the new research contradicts the older. That is why you find conflicting information on the internet, especially on blogs like mine. 

Everyone seems to want money before they tell you about these research updates. I have given my money to Monash University who have an [application](http://www.med.monash.edu/cecs/gastro/fodmap/iphone-app.html) for smart phones that gives guidance on what foods are low or high in FODMAPs. It cost $10.77 NZD when I bought it and has been pretty handy. Otherwise there are various lists that can be found with a basic google search like this [one](http://livinghappywithibs.com/2013/04/21/foodmap-food-list/). Make sure you check to see how up to date they are. 

A life-time on a strict low FODMAP diet is not ideal for your body. You should aim to reintroduce what food you can handle. A dietician will help you out with this. [This](http://www.med.monash.edu/cecs/gastro/fodmap/diet-and-ibs.html#8) is what professionals have to say about that.
